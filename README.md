### [dissinet project](http://dissinet.cz)

This interactive map application presents the most complete dataset of early cases of heresy in the West, ca. 1000–1150, compiled from original Latin sources. It shows locations, heresy cases linked to those locations, and mentions in the sources, on which the description is based. The application allows filtering by time, religious aspects (beliefs and practices), and the intervention (type of action against heresy, outcome of the case).

Each case is accompanied by a list of mentions in the sources. Each mention constitutes an independent record, which allows to appreciate differences in the descriptions of the same case, as well as filtering down only to cases (and, through them, locations) where at least one mention meets the query condition. For each mention, a detailed info box can be displayed, which contains the name of the source, time information, location(s), names used to describe the heretics and the heresy, their social characterization, a list of beliefs and practices stated in that source, and the characterization of the intervention.
