The betrothal is used by Tanchelm to financially exploit his followers.\n#There are multiple citations of St. Augustine in the letter, especially in the passages comparing Tanchelmists to Donatists and, at the end, where St. Augustine is quoted as an exhortation to resort to the help of the secular authorities in fighting heretics.\n#One of the followers of Tanchelm, Manasses the smith, was treated independently in this study under the ‚Äúoffshoot of the Tanchelm‚Äôs heresy‚Äù, as, in the letter, he is presented as the founder of a new heretical fraternity.\n#There are some similarities between the letter of the canons of Utrecht and the description of a Bourges heretic made by Gregory of Tours in his "Decem Libri Historiarum" (Book X, 25). Both heretics were called the Antichrist and considered themselves to be Christ. Each of them pretended to have contact with Mary: the heretic described by Gregory had in his company a woman whom he called Mary, while Tanchelm betrothed himself to a statue of Mary. Moreover, the letter contains information about Tanchelm\'s disciple, Manasses, who founded his fraternity of twelve men and one woman, who was called Mary and with whom Manasses\' disciples had sexual intercourse. Tanchelm and the heretic of Bourges were also accused of receiving large amounts of valuables from their faithful.

      '"Vita Norberti ab auctore posteriore" (Vita B) describes the heresy of Tanchelm, which gained numerous adherents in Antwerp. The author explains the rapid growth of heresy due to the neglect of the faithful by a local priest. The heresy is characterized primarily by anti-clericalism. Tanchelm was depicted as a prideful man who surrounded himself with royal splendor and was treated like a saint by the faithful, who even drank his bath water. The heresy ceased to exist after the Premonstratensians were brought to Antwerp.',

His disciples Sapientia, Scientia and Judicium, were sentenced to death by burning, because they refused to repudiate the heresy.\n#Eudo was portrayed as an unlettered idiot thinking that the words "per Eum qui venturus est judicare vivos et mortuos, et seculum per ignem" spoken by the celebrant referred to him. Eudo also had a special stick with one split end. Eudo explained to the synod that if the forked part is facing the sky, then God has two-thirds of the world in His possession and Eudo one-third, when Eudo turns the double end to the earth the situation is reversed and then Eudo possesses two-thirds of the world and God the remaining one-third.\n#William of Newburgh relays that Eudo had the gift of producing wonderful dishes from nothing. However, these were only devilish tricks. The author goes on to relay a story about a demon in the shape of a hawk, which Eudo once gave to a certain squire. The squire was then abducted by the devilish hawk and no one ever saw him again.',
